DoorServe is a service marketplace platform that connects customers with service providers (partners) for on-demand home services.

Here's what the business is trying to achieve:

**Core Business Purpose:** DoorServe operates as a two-sided marketplace where customers can book various home services from verified service partners. Think of it like Uber but for home services - customers browse a catalog of available services, book appointments with service providers, and manage their bookings through the platform.

#### Key Business Model:

 - Customers can browse services, book appointments, and pay for services
 - Partners (service providers) offer their services through the platform and fulfill bookings
 - Platform facilitates the connection, handles booking management, and likely takes a commission

#### Value Proposition:

 - For customers: Convenient access to vetted home service providers with easy booking and scheduling
 - For service providers: Access to a customer base and streamlined booking management
 - For the platform: Revenue through transaction fees or commissions

The system handles the entire service booking lifecycle - from service discovery and scheduling to payment processing and booking status management. It's essentially digitizing the traditional process of finding and hiring local service providers for home maintenance, repairs, cleaning, or other services.
